# Weather_APP

Is my first project with API data. This project has been made on my own and from scratch. I took inspiration from a picture of weather app UI. 
So I have started by slicing the picture into boxes that would contain my icons, descriptions, layout section etc..


What project taught me and method used. 

1. Use fetch and asynchronous function as well as promise. 
2. Use XmlHttpRequest with promise. Though we would principally use fetch method to get data from API, I found interesting to explore this way of using HTTP protocole with Js
3. How to manipulate 2D array and Json file to retrieve and use data. It's been a good way to understand how to parse and use date from Json file or a tab
4. How to write a Json file. How to transform q Json into a 2d array.
5. Manipulate DOM element to change img src url, change inner Html etc.. How to manipulate a collection of children elements to loop through etc ..
6. Create a responsive layout based on Html font size root 1vw and using Viewheight and Viewwidth to size elements proprely and dependending of size screen. 

And other things if you look at functions I used within this project !

Improvement proposal : 

(not done yet ...)
