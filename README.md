# Weather_APP

Is my first project with API data. This project has been made on my own and from scratch. 

What project taught me and method used. 

1. Use fetch and asynchronous function as well as promise. 
2. Use XmlHttpRequest with promise. Though we would principally use fetch method to get data from API, I found interesting to explore this way of using HTTP protocole with Js
3. How to manipulate 2D array and Json file to retrieve and use data. It's been a good way to understand how to parse and use date from Json file or a tab
4. How to write a Json file

And other things if you look at functions I use within this project !
